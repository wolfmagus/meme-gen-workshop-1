# Meme Generator React App Workshop
Welcome to the Meme Generator React App Workshop! In this hands-on and interactive workshop, you will learn how to build a dynamic Meme Generator using the React framework and the Vite build tool. Whether you're new to React or looking to enhance your skills, this workshop will provide you with a step-by-step guide to creating a fun and functional Meme Generator application.

## Workshop Overview
In this workshop, we will guide you through the process of building a Meme Generator React App from scratch. The workshop will cover the following main steps:
1. **Cloning the Repository**: We'll start by cloning the workshop's GitHub repository, which contains the initial project setup and basic structure.
2. **Adding the Header Component**: We'll begin by creating and integrating a Header component into the app. The Header will provide a user-friendly interface and navigation for our Meme Generator.
3. **Adding Meme Data**: You'll learn how to include meme data into your app. This data will be used to display various meme templates for users to choose from.
4. **Implementing Input Boxes**: We'll walk you through the process of adding two input boxes to the app. These input boxes will allow users to enter their desired text for the top and bottom sections of the meme.
5. **Adding handleChange Logic**: You'll learn how to implement the handleChange logic, which will dynamically update the text in the input boxes as users type.
By the end of this workshop, you will have a fully functional Meme Generator React App that enables users to select a meme template, customize the text, and create their own hilarious memes.
